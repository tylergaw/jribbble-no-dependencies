# NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED
Dribbble updated their API. Use the latest Jribbble https://github.com/tylergaw/jribbble

# Jribbble No Dependency
A jQuery-free version of https://github.com/tylergaw/jribbble.

Examples [http://tylergaw.github.com/jribbble-no-dependencies/](http://tylergaw.github.com/jribbble-no-dependencies/)

## Dependencies
* None, just that purty JavaScript that runs in your favorite Web Browser.

## Building
Jribbble uses a Makefile that is pretty much jQuery's Makefile. The Makefile adds the version number and
date to the output files then creates the Ugly version of Jribbble using [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)

NodeJS is required to build an Ugly version of Jribbble.

To build navigate to the Jribbble directory and run the `make` command

## Credit where it's due
I used ~93.2% of the GET portion of https://github.com/alotaiba/FlyJSONP
